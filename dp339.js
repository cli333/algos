// You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

// Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

// The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

// Example 1:

// Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
// Output: 16
// Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.

  let res = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {

        res += 4;
        // subtract two because take 1 from box top/left and 1 from current box
        if (grid[i] && grid[i][j - 1]) res -= 2;
        if (grid[i - 1] && grid[i - 1][j]) res -= 2;
